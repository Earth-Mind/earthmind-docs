# Welcome to EarthMind
 
## What is EarthMind?

## How it works?

The EarthMind protocol allows any protocol to delegate their governance decisions to a network of intelligence that relies on the most advanced AI Blockchain: [Bittensor]. 

At a general level, the flow is as follows:

![How it works simple](/images/how-it-works-simple.jpg)

Any protocol that implements the EarthMind client will delegate their governance decisions to the EarthMind network, which is a subnet in the [Bittensor] Blockchain that is securely connected via an EigenLayer AVS.

For a more detailed overview, check the [LifeCycle of a Governance Request].

### Components

The main components of the EarthMind protocol are:

- Bittensor subnet

- Intelligence bridge

- Ethereum Protocol

- Smart contract SDK

#### Bittensor subnet

The subnet 31 was launched in the genesis event that took place on the 29th of August (the day of judgment).

For more information about the list of miners and validators you can check our [dashboard](https://google.com).

#### Intelligence bridge

The intelligence bridge is the component that allows the EarthMind protocol to bridge intelligence from the Bittensor subnet to the Ethereum network in a permissionless
and decentralized manner.

The intelligence bridge is built on top of EigenLayer in order to secure the communication between Bittensor and Ethereum.

#### Ethereum Protocol

The EarthMind protocol deployed in Ethereum enables any protocol to delegate their governance decisions to a network of incentivised miners and validators that ensure 
the decisions will be according to the culture set by any protocol.
