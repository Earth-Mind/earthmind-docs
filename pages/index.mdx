# Welcome to EarthMind

Welcome to the official documentation of the EarthMind protocol.

## What is EarthMind?

EarthMind is a protocol for decentralized governance using advanced AI and Blockchain technology. 

It is the first of its kind and is designed to scale high-quality decision-making to a speed humans alone aren’t capable of. 

In other words, instead of having humans voting in proposals and manipulating each other, EarthMind will replace them with AI agents running language models.

The protocol is composed of four actors: consumer protocols, miners, validators and AVS operators. 

Consumer protocols using earthmind are entirely governed by the protocol, with limited or no direct human intervention. 

Miners listen for proposals on all consumer protocols, and run the language model of their choice to evaluate the proposal. 

Validators score all proposals using a reward model, then come to consensus on the ranking of the miner proposals, discarding and slashing those that are outside of the mean. 

This process is similar to the Bittensor yuma consensus model, and has several potential benefits:

Since mining is competitive, models should improve over time (especially when new foundation models are released)
The system isn’t tied to any one foundation model, yet miners can choose to use API-based models (and if banned, the system will immediately resolve to open source models)

## Manifesto

<Quote>

To keep up with an increasingly complex world, we need to scale high quality decision making to a speed humans alone aren’t capable of

While many argue AI will bring about the end of humanity, we believe exactly the opposite: that AI will enable the systems critical to the flourishing of society

Unfortunately, AI doomerism is contributing to a dangerous trend: the centralization of both AI development and model operations

Fundamentally, we will be unable to responsibly place our trust in highly centralized superintelligence that is controlled by private companies, individuals, or even states

To establish the trust necessary to facilitate true institutional replacement, the AI system must be open and verifiable, including all inputs and outputs. It also must be robust: reliable and resistant to manipulation

We are building a system that is fully transparent, resilient, self-improving, and capable of making the key decisions required to run any type of organization

Earthmind is a replacement for governance. Its capabilities will develop over time, evolving from governing protocols in the (ideal) test environment of cryptocurrencies, to managing real-world organizations… and eventually legal jurisdictions

## How it works?

The EarthMind protocol leverages advanced AI and blockchain technology to streamline governance decisions across various protocols. Here’s a detailed look at the process:

1. **Delegation of Governance Decisions:**
   - Protocols integrate the EarthMind client, allowing them to delegate governance decisions.
   - These decisions are then handled by the EarthMind network, a specialized subnet within the [Bittensor] Blockchain.

2. **AI-Powered Decision Making:**
   - EarthMind utilizes a network of AI nodes to analyze, deliberate, and decide on governance proposals.
   - This network is continuously learning and improving, ensuring that decisions are made efficiently and accurately.

3. **Secure Connectivity via EigenLayer AVS:**
   - The EarthMind network is securely connected to the Bittensor Blockchain through an [EigenLayer AVS].
   - This connection ensures that all interactions and data transfers are secure, reliable, and transparent.

4. **Lifecycle of a Governance Request:**
   - **Initiation:** A governance request is initiated by a protocol or community member.
   - **Deliberation:** AI nodes within the EarthMind network evaluate the request, considering various factors and historical data.
   - **Decision:** A decision is made and securely recorded on the Bittensor Blockchain.
   - **Implementation:** The decision is implemented by the protocol, following the guidelines set forth by the EarthMind network.

## Why it matters?

The EarthMind protocol represents a significant advancement in the field of decentralized governance, and its impact is multifaceted. Here are the key reasons why EarthMind matters:

### 1. Enhanced Decision-Making
- **AI-Driven Efficiency:** By leveraging AI, EarthMind ensures that governance decisions are made quickly and accurately, reducing human error and bias.
- **Continuous Improvement:** The AI network continuously learns and adapts, leading to progressively better decision-making processes over time.

### 2. Security and Transparency
- **Blockchain Integrity:** All decisions and actions within the EarthMind network are securely recorded on the Bittensor Blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable ledger.
- **Secure Connectivity:** The use of EigenLayer AVS ensures that the connection between EarthMind and Bittensor is secure, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the network.

### 3. Scalability and Flexibility
- **Adaptable Governance:** EarthMind can be integrated with a wide range of protocols, allowing them to delegate governance without sacrificing control or security.
- **Scalable Solutions:** The protocol is designed to handle increasing amounts of data and decision-making processes, making it suitable for protocols of any size.

### 4. Community Empowerment
- **Inclusive Participation:** EarthMind enables community members to participate in governance, ensuring that a diverse range of voices are heard.
- **Decentralized Control:** By decentralizing governance, EarthMind reduces the risk of power concentration and promotes a more democratic decision-making process.

### 5. Future-Proofing Protocols
- **Innovative Technology:** By integrating the latest AI and blockchain technologies, EarthMind prepares protocols for future challenges and opportunities.
- **Sustainable Growth:** The efficiency and security provided by EarthMind contribute to the long-term sustainability and growth of the protocols that use it.

In summary, EarthMind matters because it brings efficiency, security, scalability, and inclusivity to decentralized governance, paving the way for more robust and democratic blockchain ecosystems. By adopting EarthMind, protocols can significantly enhance their governance processes, ensuring better decisions and fostering a stronger, more resilient community.
