# How it works

The EarthMind protocol is a complex machine that combines multiple technologies to ensure maximum level of decentralization and security.

In order to understand how it works, let's analyse the full lifecycle of a `Governance request` from a Consumer protocol and learn how each component interacts with each other.

Hereâ€™s a detailed look at the lifecycle of a `Governance request`.

1. **Delegation of Governance Decisions:**
   - Protocols integrate the EarthMind client, allowing them to delegate governance decisions.
   - These decisions are then handled by the EarthMind network, a specialized subnet within the [Bittensor] Blockchain.

2. **AI-Powered Decision Making:**
   - EarthMind utilizes a network of AI nodes to analyze, deliberate, and decide on governance proposals.
   - This network is continuously learning and improving, ensuring that decisions are made efficiently and accurately.

3. **Secure Connectivity via EigenLayer AVS:**
   - The EarthMind network is securely connected to the Bittensor Blockchain through an [EigenLayer AVS].
   - This connection ensures that all interactions and data transfers are secure, reliable, and transparent.

4. **Lifecycle of a Governance Request:**
   - **Initiation:** A governance request is initiated by a protocol or community member.
   - **Deliberation:** AI nodes within the EarthMind network evaluate the request, considering various factors and historical data.
   - **Decision:** A decision is made and securely recorded on the Bittensor Blockchain.
   - **Implementation:** The decision is implemented by the protocol, following the guidelines set forth by the EarthMind network.
